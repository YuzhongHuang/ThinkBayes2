    "### One question that I've worked in the book \"thinkbayes\" is the simple cookie problem:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Suppose there are two bowls of cookies. Bowl 1 contains 30 vanilla cookies and 10 chocolate cookies. Bowl 2 contains 20 of each. Now suppose you choose one of the bowls at random and, without looking, select a cookie at random. The cookie is vanilla. What is the probability that it came from Bowl 1?\n",
    "    \n",
    "My solution follows. Our hypothesis here is that the cookie come from Bowl 1. The prior probablity of the hypothesis denoted as P(H). The data we have is a vanilla cookie, and the chance that we draw a vanilla cookie from the total is denoted as P(D). We want to know the probability that the cookie is from Bowl 1 given that it is a vanilla cookie, namely P(D|H). \n",

    "According to Bayes theorem, we have\n",
    "\n",
    "    P(H|D) = P(D|H)P(H)/P(D)\n",
    "\n",
    "For P(H), since we choose the bowl at random from 2 bowls, the chance is 1/2; P(D) would be the #vanilla cookies/#total. Therefore, it is 50/80 = 5/8; P(D|H) is the chance that we draw a vanilla cookie from bowl 1, which is 30/40 = 3/4.\n",

    "### The second question that I want to work on is one from MacKay's book:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Two people have left traces of their own blood at the scene of a crime. A suspect, Oliver, is tested and found to have type O blood. The blood groups of the two traces are found to be of type O (a common type in the local population, having frequency 60%) and of type AB (a rare type, with frequency 1%). Do these data (the blood types found at the scene) give evidence in favour [sic] of the proposition that Oliver was one of the two people whose blood was found at the scene?\n",

    "2. Oliver is not one of the two persons whose blood was found in the scene of a crime, denoted as H_1.\n",

    "\n",
    "For P(D|H_1) = 2\\*0.01\\*0.6, the chance that both of the blood comes from general public is 2\\*0.01\\*0.6. The factor 2 accounts for that the two blood samples are not ordered. Also, note that the chance of AB (1%) does not actually used in the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to our calculation, we can see that P(D|H_1) > P(D|H_0), therefore, the data does not give in favour of the proposition that Oliver was one of the two people whose blood was found at the scence."
