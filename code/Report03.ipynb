You know there are at least 20 bugs, and if you have supreme confidence in your tester, you may suppose there are around 20 bugs. But maybe your tester isn't very good. Maybe there are hundreds of bugs. How can you have any idea how many bugs there are? There’s no way to know with one tester. But if you have two testers, you can get a good idea, even if you don’t know how skilled the testers are.\n",

Let c be the number of errors both testers find. The Lincoln Index estimates the total number of errors as k1 k2 / c [I changed his notation to be consistent with mine].\"\n",

When the frog moved to (7, 13), the noise appeared to be louder. Suppose the bug is not moving. Where could that bug be hiding? "

    "I’m thinking about a problem when waiting for the Wellesley shuttle near Chapel under the big oak tree. I saw oaks falling from the tree. Imagine that the tree covers a circle of certain radius. Every minute there is an acorn fall down from the tree. And the chance of an acorn will fall at the covered circle can be modeled as a two dimensional normal distribution. What is the chance that I will be hit by an acorn given the position I’m standing, the radius of me and how long I’m standing. I think it will be an interesting question for me to solve for the final project, so that students waiting for wellesley shuttle has a better idea the chance they will get hit by acorns. "
